2D Arrays:

You create a 2D array using Vector2D().
you can technically create 1d arrays but they are just there
for the creation of the 2D Vector.
The Vector2D has three-parameter _values as items _x _y for columns and rows.
OBS make shore that _x * _y = _values if not the array cant be created.
to access the array you use Array2D().array or you can use getItem(y, x)
to get item x is the column and y is the row, note that it starts from 0.
you can use printArray() to print the whole array.
